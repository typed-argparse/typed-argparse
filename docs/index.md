## Features

- Argument parsing based on type annotation (including runtime validation).
- Support for many common types.
- Clear separation of concern between argument parsing and business logic.
- Support for super-low-latency shell [auto-completions](high_level_api/#auto-completion).
- Great for [writing sub-command CLIs](high_level_api/#sub-commands).
- Very lightweight.
- No dependencies.
- Fully typed itself, no extra type stubs required.
- Offers both a [high-level](high_level_api.md) and a [low-level](low_level_api.md) API.
  The high-level API generally requires less code to write, is fully based on type annotations, and is the preferred way for writing new CLIs.
  The low-level API is mainly a low-effort migration path for incorporating type-safety into existing CLIs based on `argparse`.


## Install

```console
$ pip install typed-argparse
```

The only requirement is a modern Python (3.6+).


## Next step

Continue with [getting started](http://127.0.0.1:8000/high_level_api/#getting-started).
